#About
Tried to experiment my MongoDB, Node.js and express.js skills by making a airbnb clone website, its not perfect looking but it is fully functional. You can see listings avaiable for rent, Create your own listing, Update and Delete your listing, See the detailed listing etc.

#Tech Used
Express.js, Node.js, MongoDB, EJS, JavaScript, Bootstrap.css and many more ....

#For Nerds ( -_- )
If you want to see the web
- download the whole repo folder
- open the folder in your IDE
- open the os terminal (not IDE one)
- run the mongod server ( use command 'mongod' ) (note: make sure you have mongo demon server installed and attached with terminal)
- create a new tab in the terminal and run the mongosh server in it ( use command 'mongosh' ) (note: make sure you have mongoshell attached with terminal)
- once you have done these above steps, try runnning the express app using command 'node app.js' or 'nodemon app.js' in IDE terminal
- open your browser and go to the system localhost ( write localhost:port_number which in this case is 'localhost:3000' ) and boom the website will open :)
